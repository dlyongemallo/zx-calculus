# `zx-calculus`: a library to typeset ZX-calculus in LaTeX

This library (based on the great TikZ and Tikz-cd packages) allows you to typeset ZX-calculus directly in LaTeX. It comes with a default (but highly customizable) style. For more information, see the documentation in [`doc/zx-calculus.pdf`][1].

The project, created by LÃ©o Colisson, is hosted at https://github.com/leo-colisson/zx-calculus . Feel free to report any bug there. It is licensed under MIT.
